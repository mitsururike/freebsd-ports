Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language.
It visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly
in syntactic and semantic details. Its design is oriented toward
concerns of "programming in the large", that is,
of creating and maintaining boundaries - both abstract and operational -
that preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency.
